        <h3>Web Developer | Sports Fanatic | Aspiring Entreprenuer</h3>
        <p>Hello, My Name is Servio Mora. I am a passionate Web Developer who's main goal is to be part of a great team and learn new skills and technologies everyday. Along with improving my development skills, I want to be able to put my ideas in the hands of thousands or even millions of people. Constant innovation is what makes the world a better place, and I want to be part of the few that get to achieve those milestones.</p>
        <p>I am located in the Greater NYC area, I have lots of experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript. Along with JavaScript, I love using the many frameworks JavaScript has such as Angular Js, Node Js, Meteor Js, React Js. Everyday I am constantly improving my skills and working to be the best Developer I can be. I am also familiar with many build tools and database technologies. I am not only proficient in Front-End Development, but Back-End as well.</p>
        <p>When I am not coding I love to excersise, watch movies, play video games, hang out with friends, and explore new adventures life has to offer. If you've read this far, I really appreciate it. Please feel free to view the rest of my page and contact me if you like what you see.</p>
